##Egg Sizes of Northern Rockhopper Penguines - Data Description

###Data source
Egg size data were collected from [Tristan da Cunha] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha) in the South Atlantic, [located ~2800 kilometers offshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tristan+da+Cunha/@-37.1160481,-30.2136665,4z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x25a3b1a1af6dc9b:0x69ee2d95dc98aedb!8m2!3d-37.1052489!4d-12.2776838). The egg size data were compiled by [Dr. Alex Bond] (https://alexanderbond.org/) and uses contemporary data on egg size (length & breadth), data from museum collections, and reconstructed data from published accounts (e.g. simulated data from a mean, SD, n) to examine how egg size has changed over the last 150 years.

##Columns in dataset
Source = Museum (who owns the data) or person (who collected the data)  
Specimen ID = Identifier for a sample within a dataset (aka within the museum)  
Location = Island within Tristan da Cunha (Trisan da Cunha, Inaccessible, Nightingale, Gough)  
Day, Month, Year = Date of collection  
A or B egg = Laying order, where A (first laid), B (second laid), and U (unknown)  
Length (mm), Breadth (mm) = Length and width of egg (from Bond et al. 2016: "We measured egg length and breadth using dial callipers to the nearest 0.1mm. Measurement error, assessed by the repeated measuring of the same eggs, was in the order of 0.1â€“0.2mm."  
Volume = Volume of egg (measuring procedure unknown)  
Reference = Extra information about the source of the data. Could be an article reference, extra info about the collection processes, how data was simulated, who measured the eggs, etc.
